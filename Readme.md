# Reliable UDP â€” QUIC-style Secure & Reliable Transport Over UDP

This repository contains a C implementation of a **reliable, secure UDP transport layer inspired by QUIC**.
It replaces the traditional **TCP + TLS 1.2 stack** with:
- user-space reliability (no retransmit delay due to HoL blocking)
- integrated TLS inside transport (using OpenSSL)
- low-latency connection setup

---

## âœ¨ Key Features

- **Built on raw UDP** â€” custom reliability logic (ACKs, retransmit, numbering)
- **Secure channel using TLS 1.2** (OpenSSL)
- **All application data fully encrypted**
- **Head-of-Line Blocking eliminated** through frame-level delivery
- **Multiple Connection IDs** â€” supports connection migration/NAT rebinding
- **2-RTT handshake** for first-time client connection
- **1-RTT handshake** for resumed connections
- **Cross-platform C implementation**
  - âœ… Windows (Winsock)
  - âœ… Linux / Unix (POSIX sockets)
- **Drop-in alternative to TCP + TLS 1.2**

## ðŸ§  Core Concepts Implemented

### âœ… Reliable Transport on UDP
- Packet numbers
- Acknowledgements
- Retransmission logic
- Loss handling

### âœ… QUIC-style Connection Management
- Multiple connection IDs
- Stateless retry model
- 2-RTT initial handshake
- 1-RTT resumed session

### âœ… Security Integration
- TLS 1.2 handshake integrated at transport layer
- All frames encrypted end-to-end

### âœ… No Head of Line Blocking
Unlike TCP, packets are processed independently,
so a lost packet does **not stall all streams**.
